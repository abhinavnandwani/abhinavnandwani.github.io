I'm Abhinav Nandwani, a Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a passion for building intelligent systems at the intersection of hardware and AI. With a strong foundation in RTL design, GPU microarchitecture, and scalable machine learning, I enjoy turning low-level engineering into high-impact innovation.

My work spans across developing AI accelerators on FPGAs, architecting pipelined CPUs, and exploring fault resilience in transformer-based vision models on NVIDIA GPUs. I’ve also contributed to cutting-edge computational genomics research, applying large language models to unravel insights from single-cell RNA data.

Whether I’m designing autonomous robots or simulating instruction-level faults in tensor cores, I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and the desire to push technical boundaries. I'm always looking to collaborate on transformative projects in AI, hardware design, and systems research.
