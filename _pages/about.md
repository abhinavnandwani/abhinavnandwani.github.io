I'm Abhinav Nandwani, a Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison with a passion for building intelligent systems at the intersection of hardware and AI. With a strong foundation in RTL design, GPU microarchitecture, and scalable machine learning, I enjoy turning low-level engineering into high-impact innovation.

A systems architecture-level thinker who leverages deep RTL/hardware knowledge to drive the design of domain-specific accelerators (DSAs). This involves the following 

1. Understanding the workload deeply (AI/ML, graphics, healthcare, etc.)
2. Knowing what parts of it are bottlenecks
3. Designing hardware that mitigates those bottlenecks
4. Adhere to performance, memory hierarchy, communication models, and software implications making them implementation guides for teams (RTL, VLSI, verification, compiler)
